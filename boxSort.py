#     Getting a Different Number
# Given an array arr of unique nonnegative integers, implement a function getDifferentNumber 
# that finds the smallest nonnegative integer that is NOT in the array.

# Even if your programming language of choice doesnâ€™t have that restriction (like Python), 
# assume that the maximum value an integer can have is MAX_INT = 2^31-1. So, for instance, 
# the operation MAX_INT + 1 would be undefined in our case.

# Your algorithm should be efficient, both from a time and a space complexity perspectives.

# Solve first for the case when youâ€™re NOT allowed to modify the input arr. If successful 
# and still have time, see if you can come up with an algorithm with an improved space complexity 
# when modifying arr is allowed. Do so without trading off the time complexity.

# Analyze the time and space complexities of your algorithm.
